## Reflection: hobbyTracker.js

### What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

I learned how `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` work by seeing them used in real code. I always hear about higher-order functions, but this helped me understand how they actually process data inside an array of objects.

### What was the most confusing part?

The `reduce()` function was the most confusing at first. I had to read it a few times to figure out how it keeps track of the total. Once I followed the flow step by step, it started to make more sense.

This assignment helped me get better at both reading and writing code.
